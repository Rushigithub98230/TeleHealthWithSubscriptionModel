# Admin Portal Advanced Features – Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of advanced features for the TeleHealth admin portal: bulk actions, advanced filtering, real-time updates, and user impersonation. Each feature includes a checklist, best practices, and a progress tracker.

---

## 1. Bulk Actions

### **Goal:**
Enable admins to select multiple items (subscriptions, users, plans, etc.) and perform actions (delete, status change, assign) in bulk.

### **Checklist:**
- [ ] Add checkboxes to each table row and a “select all” checkbox in the header
- [ ] Maintain a list of selected IDs in component state
- [ ] Add bulk action dropdown/buttons above each table
- [ ] Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Wire up bulk actions to backend (batch endpoint or loop over single-item APIs)
- [ ] Show summary toast/snackbar after completion
- [ ] Add E2E and unit tests for bulk actions

### **Best Practices:**
- Disable bulk actions if nothing is selected
- Show clear feedback for partial failures
- Log all bulk actions in the audit log

## 2. Advanced Filtering

### **Goal:**
Allow admins to filter data by multiple fields (status, date range, plan, user role, etc.) and combine filters.

### **Checklist:**
- [ ] Add filter panel or advanced filter dialog above each table
- [ ] Use Angular Reactive Forms for filter controls
- [ ] Update displayed data on filter change (client-side or via API query params)
- [ ] Optionally, allow saving and reusing filter presets
- [ ] Add E2E and unit tests for filtering

### **Best Practices:**
- Debounce filter input to avoid excessive API calls
- Show active filters as chips or summary text
- Allow clearing all filters with one click

---

## 3. Real-Time Updates

### **Goal:**
Automatically update tables and dashboards when data changes, and show real-time notifications for important events.

### **Checklist:**
- [ ] Integrate SignalR/WebSocket client in Angular
- [ ] Subscribe to relevant backend events (subscriptions, payments, users, etc.)
- [ ] Refresh UI data on event receipt
- [ ] Show toast/snackbar or badge for new notifications
- [ ] Highlight updated rows/data
- [ ] Add E2E and unit tests for real-time updates

### **Best Practices:**
- Throttle UI updates to avoid flicker
- Allow admins to mute or pause real-time updates if needed
- Log all real-time events in the audit log

---

## 4. User Impersonation

### **Goal:**
Allow admins to impersonate another user (patient, provider) to see their view and troubleshoot issues.

### **Checklist:**
- [ ] Add “Impersonate” button in user management table/details
- [ ] Implement backend endpoint to generate impersonation token/session
- [ ] Store impersonation state in local storage or a service
- [ ] Update frontend to use impersonated user’s token/session
- [ ] Show clear banner/indicator when impersonating, with “Return to Admin” button
- [ ] Log all impersonation actions in the audit log
- [ ] Add E2E and unit tests for impersonation

### **Best Practices:**
- Require confirmation before impersonating
- Restrict impersonation to superadmins
- Always log impersonation start/stop events

# Fees Management

## Overview
Admin sets a minimum and maximum fee range for each service category. Providers propose their own fee for each category (without seeing the range, but with access to market averages). Provider’s proposed fee is submitted for admin review. Admin reviews the proposed fee, sees analytics (market average, other providers’ fees, etc.), and can approve or decline with remarks. If declined, provider is notified and can resubmit. Only approved fees are active and used for bookings and payouts. All changes and approvals are logged for compliance.

## Fee Proposal Flow
1. **Admin sets fee range** for each category (min/max).
2. **Provider proposes fee** for each category (no range shown, but market data may be shown).
3. **Admin reviews fee proposal** with analytics (market average, provider distribution, etc.).
4. **Admin approves or declines** with remarks.
5. **Provider notified** and can resubmit if declined.
6. **Only approved fees are active.**

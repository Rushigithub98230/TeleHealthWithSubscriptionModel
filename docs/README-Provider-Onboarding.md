# Provider Onboarding

## Overview
Providers self-register via a secure, multi-step onboarding process. They submit personal and professional information, credentials, and required documents. The admin reviews all submissions, verifies credentials, and approves or rejects the provider. Providers cannot offer services until approved. Providers can see their onboarding status and update documents if needed.

## Onboarding Steps
1. **Self-Registration:** Provider enters basic info (name, email, specialty, password).
2. **Email Verification:** Provider verifies their email address.
3. **Profile Completion:** Provider submits:
   - Government-issued ID
   - Medical license(s) and certifications
   - NPI/DEA (if applicable)
   - Malpractice insurance
   - Education and work history
   - Professional photo and bio
4. **Compliance & Agreements:** Provider consents to background checks and e-signs legal agreements (HIPAA, platform terms, etc.).
5. **Admin Review:** Admin reviews all documents and background check results, then approves or rejects with remarks.
6. **Onboarding Completion:** Approved providers receive a welcome email and gain access to the provider dashboard.

# Provider Payout

## Overview
Payouts are processed monthly or quarterly. Payouts are based on the number of services delivered, the categories, and the volume within the period. For one-time consults, payout is split between provider and admin based on the provider’s approved fee and platform commission. For subscription consults, payout is based on the number of consults per category, using the provider’s approved fee for that category. Admin can review, approve, or hold payouts. Providers have a dashboard to view earnings, payout history, and download statements.

## Payout Flow
1. **Earnings Accumulation:** Each completed consult adds to provider’s pending payout balance.
2. **Payout Cycle:** At the end of each cycle, system aggregates eligible earnings and generates payout batches.
3. **Admin Review:** Admin can approve/hold payouts (for compliance/disputes).
4. **Payout Execution:** Funds are transferred to provider’s chosen payment method.
5. **Post-Payout:** Providers can download statements; all transactions are logged.
